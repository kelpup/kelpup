# Avalible Kelpup Releases for Download:

### General Philosophy
Our goal is to regularly release new Puppies that have added resources and features to aid students interested in Linux. Our base pup will be the BionicPup64-8.0, and from there we will add and remove material to make it our own distro. See the flow chart below for more information.

### Kelpup02 - 3/16/2022
Back after break! Big changes have been going on around here, as we have switched our base Puppy entirely from versions 00 and 01! Welcome the newest member of the Kelpup family, the FassaPup-64.

Already in this release we've added features like Conky and gcc, and have made customizations to the .bashrc and .vimrc to aid new users. We hope to continue to add better versions of classic compilers while making astetic features users will enjoy.  

### Kelpup01 - 3/2/2022
In this latest version of Kelpup, we have continued to add resources for users while developing our own flair! The background got a major makeover, and the file system now includes Linux tips and tricks. Additionally, we have included Conky, a program that displays CPU usage, RAM avalibility, and other statistics in real time on the desktop. We hope that new users will find the Conky display interactive and "tech-y"! Click the link below to download.

### Kelpup00 - 2/23/2022
This release is simply a "test" launch. It is derived from the "BionicPup64-8.0" distro, and is almost an exact copy. We made a few changes to the directory hierarchy and the included files for proof of concept. Click the link below to download.
