# User Help
We realize that some things in Kelpup are not as intuitive as they might be in more common Operating Systems such as Windows or MacOS, so we decided to add this page to help clarify some of the more ambiguous elements of Kelpup!

NOTE: This page is currently being worked on! Come back soon for the finalized version :)

### Connecting to WiFi (Not working for Mac currently)
Connecting to WiFi is quite easy but not as intuitive as in other operating systems, so here's a quick tutorial on how to do it :)

Step 1: Click on the tools icon at the bottom to open Puppy Setup (3rd icon from the right), then click on the Internet button

Step 2: Choose the Wired or wireless LAN option

Step 3: A Network Connection Wizard window should pop up. The Simple Network Setup option is the easiest to use, so we'll go ahead and use that one

Step 4: Once you're here, you'll see the enp0s3 button at the bottom right. Do NOT click on that button, click instead on the one that should be next to it that starts with wlan (it's not showing on this screenshot because the available drivers weren't available on the machine being used)

Step 5: Now, just choose your network and you should be good to go! :)

### Package Manager (Downloading Stuff)
The PPM (Puppy Package Manager) is quite easy to use! (NOTE: You will need an internet connection to use it the way explained below)

Step 1: Click on the PPM icon (2nd from the right) and then click on Install Applications

Step 2: Once you've done that, click on Puppy Package Manager
PICTURE 2

Step 3: Then, just search for whatever it is you want to install, click the package you want to install, have Auto install be the mode, and click on Do it! It's that easy! (NOTE: Some packages won't download successfully, PPM isn't perfect)

### Multiple Desktops (Pink Thing at Top)
It might not seem obvious, but you can have multiple desktops on Kelpup :) The three boxes on the top left are the different desktop environments. The pink one is the current desktop, and you can switch between the three by just clicking on them!

### Navigating Files without Terminal (but ideally use the terminal :))
