```markdown
Release Notes:
- Python! We switched to Fossa because it comes with Python already installed :)
- Modified .bashrc 
  - to have a nicer looking user prompt (in the terminal)
  - so that each time the user opens a terminal window, a Linux Command Line tip is printed
- Modified .vimrc 
  - so that users have at least a basic .vimrc when trying out VIM
  (NOTE: VIM is not installed yet)
- A terminal window pops up on Startup, so users are immediately encouraged to explore the command line
- Conky runs automatically on Startup
- Changed a wait time at boot-up from 60 seconds to 5 seconds 
  (NOTE: It still prints "pausing for 60 seconds", but it's just 5 now)
- Palemoon is automatically the default browser (without this change, clicking on the browser button would not work)
- Created pTheme specifically for Kelpup
