### Kelpup02 - 3/16/2022
Back after break! Big changes have been going on around here, as we have switched our base Puppy entirely from versions 00 and 01! Welcome the newest member of the Kelpup family, the FossaPup-64.

In this release we've added features like Conky, and have made customizations to the .bashrc and .vimrc to aid new users. We hope to continue to add better versions of classic compilers while making aesthetic features users will enjoy.  

### Kelpup01 - 3/2/2022
In this latest version of Kelpup, we have continued to add resources for users while developing our own flair! The background got a major makeover, and the file system now includes Linux tips and tricks. Additionally, we have included Conky, a program that displays CPU usage, RAM avalibility, and other statistics in real time on the desktop. We hope that new users will find the Conky display interactive and "tech-y"! Click the link below to download.

### Kelpup00 - 2/23/2022
This release is simply a "test" launch. It is derived from the "BionicPup64-8.0" distro, and is almost an exact copy. We made a few changes to the directory hierarchy and the included files for proof of concept. Click the link below to download.
