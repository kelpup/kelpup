<img src="kelpie.jpeg" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

### Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to create a simple, easy to use linux distribution with the hopes that it will be education to underprivileged computer science students. We would like for the distribution to be accessable via a flashdrive, and for it to run on older, slower machines. 

```markdown
# Goals
- Start with and customize a puppy linux distribution
- Remove unnecessary components from source code
- Ensure the distro can be burnt onto and used off of a flash drive
- Ensure the distro runs even on older machines 
- Add features that help new users navigate the linux command line
```
