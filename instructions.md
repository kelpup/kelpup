# Windows Instructions for Burning Our ISO

### Introduction - What is an ISO?
We say that you can "burn our ISO" onto a flashdrive, and use that to run our disro on your computer. But what does that really mean? 

> "The idea behind an ISO imge is that you can archive an exact digital copy of a disc, and then later use that image to burn a new disc that's in turn an exact copy of the original (...) most operating systems allow you to mount an ISO image as a virtual disc, in which case all your apps treat it as if a real optical disc were inserted." [source](https://www.howtogeek.com/356714/what-is-an-iso-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/)

So when you download our ISO file, it is really just a copy of the linux distrubtion we have created. By "burning" it onto a flashdrive, you are just making your own portable copy that you can then insert and boot on your own machine.

### What You'll Need
```markdown
- A 4GB or larger flashdrive
- Microsoft Windows
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/), a third party ISO burning application
- [Kelpup](), our personalized Linux distro's ISO image
```

### Step 1.) Download Rufus
Following the link above to Rufus' website, navigate to the large "download" button near the top of the home page.

Upon booting up the software, the following option menu will greet you:

The first step is to let Rufus know what device you'll be burning to. To do this, plug in your external USB, and navigate to the "Device" field of the menu. From there, select your personal USB. 

### Set 3.) Download and Select the Kelpup Linux Distro as Your ISO File
