## About Kelpup
Kelpup is an in-development distribution designed to be an easy first step into Linux. All you need to run KelPup is a USB and a computer! 

Kelpup is a woof-built [Puppy Linux](https://puppylinux.com/) distribution that was built off [FossaPup64](https://blog.puppylinux.com/fossapup64-release). Puppy Linux was created by [Barry Kauler](https://bkhome.org/news/) and FossaPup was developed by [Phil Broughton](https://github.com/mrfricks).

### Getting Started

To download and use our custom linux distro, click on the following links for either [Windows](../Instructions/WindowsDownload.md) or [macOS](../Instructions/MacDownload.md) for instructions. You'll have to install some easy-to-use software that burns our code directly onto a flashdrive. Then, you can reboot your computer and start playing with our distro!
