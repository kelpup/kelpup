# User Help
We realize that some things in Kelpup are not as intuitive as they might be in more common Operating Systems such as Windows or MacOS, so we decided to add this page to help clarify some of the more ambiguous elements of Kelpup!

NOTE: This page is currently being worked on! Come back soon for the finalized version :)

### Connecting to WiFi (Not working for Mac currently)
Connecting to WiFi is quite easy but not as intuitive as in other operating systems, so here's a quick tutorial on how to do it :)

Step 1: Click on the tools icon at the bottom to open Puppy Setup (3rd icon from the right), then click on the Internet button

Step 2: Choose the Wired or wireless LAN option

Step 3: A Network Connection Wizard window should pop up. The Simple Network Setup option is the easiest to use, so we'll go ahead and use that one

Step 4: Once you're here, you'll see the enp0s3 button at the bottom right. Do NOT click on that button, click instead on the one that should be next to it that starts with wlan (it's not showing on this screenshot because the available drivers weren't available on the machine being used)

Step 5: Now, just choose your network and you should be good to go! :)

### Package Manager (Downloading Stuff)
### Multiple Desktops (Pink Thing at Top)
### Navigating Files without Terminal (but ideally use the terminal :))
### More Stuff Later :)
