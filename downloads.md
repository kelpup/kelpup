Note: Your laptop protects your USBs from applications, so they can't make changes like deleting your files behind your back. However, since we want to install KelPup to the USB, you'll have to give UNetbootin permission to do so, which is why it asks for your password.
8. When UNetbootin opens, select PuppyLinux from the Distribution dropdown menu. Ensure ISO is selected in the middle section, and click the button with the three dots on the righthand side and navigate to your downloaded KelPup ISO file. Select USB Drive under the Type dropdown menu.

9. The Drive dropdown menu will list external drives (like USBs) plugged into your computer. If it's empty, that's okay. Plug in your USB, and a name should pop up. It won't be named what your USB is named, but what your laptop calls the USB. 
Note: If you're concerned you don't have the right drive selected, unplug and plug back in your USB. The drive should disappear and reappear.
Note: If you're USB doesn't show up, it's probably just not formatted correctly. Go to the USB formatting instructions!
