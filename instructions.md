# Windows Instructions for Burning Our ISO

### Introduction - What is an ISO?
We say that you can "burn our ISO" onto a flashdrive, and use that to run our disro on your computer. But what does that really mean? 

> The idea behind an ISO imge is that you can archive an exact digital copy of a disc, and then later use that image to burn a new disc that's in turn an exact copy of the original (...) most operating systems allow you to mount an ISO image as a virtual disc, in which case all your apps treat it as if a real optical disc were inserted.

So when you download our ISO file, it is really just a copy of the linux distrubtion we have created. By "burning" it onto a flashdrive, you are just making your own portable copy that you can then insert and boot on your own machine.
