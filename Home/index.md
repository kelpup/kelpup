## Welcome to the KelPup Lightweight Linux Distribution

<img src="kelpie-1000.jpeg" alt="hi" class="inline"/>

### Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to create a simple, easy to use linux distribution. It is our hope that the distro will be accessable and educational to underprivileged students interested in computer science. The distribution should be bootable off of a flashdrive, and simplistic enough to run on older, slower machines. 

### Getting Started

To download and use our custom linux distro, click on the following links for either [Windows](../Instructions/WindowsDownload.md) or [macOS](../Instructions/MacDownload.md) for instructions. You'll have to install some easy-to-use software that burns our code directly onto a flashdrive. Then, you can reboot your computer and start playing with our distro!

```markdown
Group Goals
- Start with and customize a puppy linux distribution
- Remove unnecessary components from source code
- Ensure the distro can be burnt onto and used off of a flash drive
- Ensure the distro runs even on older machines 
- Add features that help new users navigate the linux command line
```
