# How to Contribute
We'd love your help! You could modifiy Kelpup by working on Woof-CE, help us with the website, or even with the command line games that we want to implement eventually into Kelpup.

### Woof-CE
Contribute to Kelpup itself by modifying the ISO build scripts and the files it uses on <a href="https://github.com/kelpup/woof-CE#contribute" style="color: #b5e853; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">woof-CE</a>! The README has good first issues to get started and instructions on how to contribute with GitHub.

### Command Line Games
Develop some command line games for us! We want users to be able to start learning how to use the terminal right away when they run Kelpup, and we're developing them <a href="https://github.com/kelpup/command-line-games" style="color: #b5e853; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">here</a>. Write your own or contribute to what we've started!
