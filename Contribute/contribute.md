# How to Contribute
There are many ways to contribute to our project! You could modifiy Kelpup by working on Woof-CE, help us with the website, or even with the command line games that we want to implement eventually into Kelpup.

### Woof-CE
If you want to contribute to Kelpup, the README in the GitHub repository has instructions on how you could go about contributing. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/kelpup/woof-CE#contribute" style="color: #b5e853; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">link</a> to our Woof-CE repository.

### Website
If you find any bugs, typos, or have suggestions on how to improve the website, the repository for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/kelpup/kelpup.github.io" style="color: #b5e853; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">here</a>. The deployed website you're on right now is in the gh-pages branch, so that's where you should be looking. Either create an issue or a pull request, and we will make sure to check it out!

### Command Line Games
The command line games are a work in progress that we plan to implement into Kelpup eventually. The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/kelpup/command-line-games" style="color: #b5e853; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">here</a>. The README will be updated soon to have a more detailed explanation of what the games are supposed to be and how to use them and contribute to them.
